Bitcoin scaling problems

When bitcoin was first proposed, I argued that the proposed algorithm 
failed to scale.

Well, when getting started, scaling does not matter.  Now, however, a 
bitcoin wallet is starting to cost substantial bandwidth and processing 
power.  There are plans to address this, but I am underwhelmed by those 
plans. The proposed plans will make bitcoin more centralized, and will 
still have scaling issues.

Seems to me that we need an algorithm where no one computer needs to 
keep a copy of all transactions, or even a complete listing of who owns 
what coins, so as to maintain scaling all the way to operating all of the 
world’s transactions, and full decentralization both.

Gold also has problems, in that transporting gold from one place to another 
is slow and risky. Easier to leave the gold in one place, and transfer 
ownership. This, however tempts the proprietor of that place to misconduct 
(fractional reserve and term transformation) and exposes the proprietor to 
attack. So the most trusted proprietor winds up being the most powerful state, 
which is to say, the USG. Banks around the world leave their gold with Fort 
Knox the New York Fed, and simply move ownership of it. And that state then 
steals the gold. Banks that are owed gold by the USG have been asking for 
their gold back, asking for physical gold, and not getting it.

I recommend a system in which the private key that is the rightful owner of 
a bitcoin possesses data showing that he rightly acquired bitcoins from someone 
that was previously acknowledged as the rightful owner of those bitcoins by a 
previous leading hash of the state of bitcoin ownership, and a hash chain showing 
that his rightful ownership is acknowledged in the current leading hash of the 
state of bitcoin ownership, but not very many other people possess that data, 
not everyone in the system possesses that data, so not everyone in the system has 
to download that data and check it for internal consistency. When he spends the 
bitcoins, he proves ownership by showing that his ownership is in the most recent 
hash – but the recipient’s wallet would not have that information until supplied. 
This sounds easy, but the tricky bit doing it without risk of the network 
splitting into inconsistent states.

Instead of this, the proposed scaling fix for bitcoin is a very large blocksize, 
which would mean that only a small number of big wealthy institutions are full 
participants in the system – which brings us back to the problems we have been 
having with gold and fiat money.
